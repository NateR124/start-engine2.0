## StartEngine Interview App: Take 2
Hello (again) Start Engine! Here's my (re)submission of the interview code. As the role I'm applying for is a bit less senior, I figure the best way to contexualize my submission is in two parts:

1) What have I learned in the past few months, that can be seen in this submission:

- Utilizing the "createSlice()" Redux interface, with formatting inspiration from "create-react-app  --template redux-typescript"
- Taking time to read through the RTK and Redux style recommendation guides, implement them throughout
- A much better understanding of MVC as a whole, Redux, React.
- More familiarity with Node, VS Code, and local build tools
- Typescript, and interfaces!
- LESS
- Jest for Tests
- ES6 Javascript
- Flexbox and Grid-template displays
- Async calls, normalizing JSON data, and Promises

2) What things will I be taking the time to teach myself over the coming weeks/months:

- Beginning to understand the time/benefit trade offs of the various tools/concepts involved
- I'd like to discover more existing 3rd party libraries or tools to save myself from writing things from scratch (ex: Normalizr, Kendo Grid, etc.)
- RTK Query looked interesting, as opposed to using Thunks
- Getting comfortable with the artistic process of designing a webpage. Templates, tools, layout, UI/UX, concept art programs like Figma, etc.

Parting thoughts:

My first submission was what I could teach myself in two days, from having only used pre ES6 Javascript and notepad++ prior.

What you see now is how I've improved with my spare hours over the past couple of months. I've built a few more redux apps, as well as worked with Angular, NGRX, Node and VS Code for our current work project. Overall I see myself as likely having a few more weak spots to iron out, but I feel confident I can continue quickly improving myself with various resources online/online communities I've found.
