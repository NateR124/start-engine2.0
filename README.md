## StartEngine Interview App: Take 2
Hello (again) Start Engine! Here's my (re)submission of the interview code. As the role I'm applying for is a bit less senior, I figure the best way to contexualize my submission is in two parts:

1) What have I learned in the past few months, that can be seen in this submission:

- Utilizing the "createSlice()" Redux interface, with formatting inspiration from "create-react-app  --template redux-typescript"
- Taking time to read through the RTK and Redux style recommendation guides, implement them throughout
- A much better understanding of the MVC pattern as a whole, as well as specifics to Redux and React.
- More familiarity with Node, VS Code, webpack, dependencies, etc.
- Typescript and interfaces!
- Material UI components (because it's what you guys use!)
- ES6 Javascript
- Async calls, normalizing JSON data, and Promises

2) What things will I be taking the time to teach myself over the coming weeks/months:

- Beginning to understand the time/benefit trade offs of the various tools/concepts involved
- I'd like to discover more existing 3rd party libraries or tools to save myself from writing things from scratch (ex: Normalizr, Kendo Grid, etc.)
- Get a better understanding of the responsive API, MUI5's APIs, theming, etc. In general use it as a guide line to find inspiration for better page design.
- Things related to page sizing on different platforms (mobile, tablet, 1920x1080, 1270x720, basically things MUI5 solves), page resizing
- RTK Query looked interesting, as opposed to using Thunks
- Use the extra time to set up tests with Jest

## Parting thoughts:

My first submission was what I could teach myself in two days, from having only used pre ES6 Javascript and notepad++ prior.

What you see now is how I've improved with my spare hours over the past couple of months. I've built a few more redux apps, as well as worked with Angular, NGRX, Node and VS Code for our current work project. I think there are a lot of things I could have improved, but hopefully this is good proof that I can continue to improve on my own, and will do so even more rapidly were it to become my full time job.

Thanks so much and excited to hear back!
