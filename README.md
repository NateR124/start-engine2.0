## StartEngine Interview App: Take 2
Hello (again) Start Engine! Here's my (re)submission of the interview code, with the following improvements:

- Utilizing cleaner "createSlice()" interface, with formatting inspiration from "create-react-app  --template redux-typescript"
- Actually becoming familiar with Node and the build processes surrounding its use
- Pure JS to Typescript (data definitions and interfaces)
- Changed CSS to more cleanly organized SCSS
- Got rid of janky CSS behavior
- Actually utilizing VS Code and build tools instead of the browser based "codesandbox"
- Went on a few long walks with the "Redux Dev Kit" and improved style guide lines

My first submission was what I could teach myself in two days, from having only used pre ES6 Javascript and notepad++ prior.

What you see now is how I've improved with my off hours over the past few months. I've built a few more redux apps, as well as worked with Angular, NGRX, Node and VS Code for our current work project. Overall I see myself as likely having a few more weak spots to iron out, but I feel confident I can continue quickly improving myself with various resources online, including:

React-Redux website: https://react-redux.js.org/
Redux Dev Tools style guide: 
Online communities like the Reactiflux Discord.
